# StACKER
**St**acking **A**nalysis and **C**onformational **K**inetics for **E**xamining **R**esidues

Analyzes pi-stacking interactions between residues in [Molecular Dynamics (MD)](https://github.com/esakkas24/stacker/docs/background.md) trajectories.

Developed by Eric Sakkas ([esakkas@wesleyan.edu](mailto:esakkas@wesleyan.edu)) in the [Weir Lab](https://weirlab.research.wesleyan.edu/) at Wesleyan University.

Runs on Python 3.5.x and has the following dependencies: [mdtraj](https://www.mdtraj.org/1.9.8.dev0/index.html)

## Overview

Manipulates the outputs of an MD simulation and analyzes the pi-stacking interactions. Creates a "Pi-Stacking Fingerprint" for a structure at each frame. Presents Pi-stacking interactions between two residues through analysis of their relevant movement.
